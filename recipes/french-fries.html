    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Everyone loves french fries, why not try making your own. This recipe is easy to follow and only requires time. A simple recipe to create a simple treat, yet we all agree that it is simply delicious.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>10 large russet potatoes, peeled and rinsed</li>
        <li>2 quarts vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice the potatoes into ½ inch thick sticks.</li>
        <li>Soak the potato slices in cold water for a minimum of one hour, and up to overnight.</li>
        <li>Rinse the fries twice with cold water.</li>
        <li>Lay the fries on paper towels or a clean dishcloth and pat them as dry as possible.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or dutch oven to 300 degrees F. You’ll need to fry in about six batches, begin with a quart of oil and add more as needed. Frying too many at once makes them less crispy.</li>
        <li>Use a slotted spoon to add the potatoes to the oil and fry for about 5-6 minutes. The oil should bubble lightly, we’re only heating the potatoes, we don’t want them to crisp yet.</li>
        <li>Place the cooked potatoes on a paper towel lined plate and fry the rest of the remaining batches.</li>
        <li>Increase the heat to 400 degrees F and fry each batch a second time until they are crisp and golden-brown, about 5 minutes or so.</li>
        <li>Remove them and place them on dry paper towels. Sprinkle with salt as soon as they come out.</li>
    </ol>
