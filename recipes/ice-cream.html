    <h2>Description</h2>
    <em>Notice that this recipe requires an ice cream maker.</em> During the summer heat it is a must to cool off. And what better way to cool off than with a yummy treat. This strawberry ice cream recipe is among the best due to its ease to follow and the rich flavor of the ice cream that it produces.
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups strawberries, hulled and diced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1/2 cup half and half</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix strawberries, honey, sugar, and lemon juice. Allow to sit 15-20 minutes, or until the strawberries have released their juices.</li>
        <li>Mash the mixture with a potato masher, fork, or pastry cutter until there are no longer any large strawberry pieces (if you prefer a smooth ice cream, use a blender or food processor instead*).</li>
        <li>To the strawberries, mix heavy cream, half and half, and vanilla extract. Stir just until combined.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture into your ice cream maker, and follow your manufacturer's instructions (mine took about 15-20 minutes to churn). You can eat the ice cream soft-serve, or freeze it in an airtight container for 3-4 hours to thicken it up slightly. For best results, allow the ice cream to sit at room temperature for about 5-10 minutes to soften before serving.</li>
    </ol>
